# Quantum-Sim
USE TURBOWARP
Quantum physics, in Scratch.
This is a simulation of the four fundamental forces: Electromagnetism, the Strong force, the Weak force, and Gravity. (Gravity is not included, it's too weak compared to the others.)
It also includes all the particles of the standard model, except the photon and gluon because they would just fly off the screen instantly.
This simulation technically isn't quantum physics, as there are no wavefunctions or anything like that. It is particle physics though.
Disclaimer: Can be very buggy at times.
Disclaimer: I've scaled down the strength of all the forces significantly for visibility, but they are still the same strengths relative to each other and they still behave the same, just weaker.

Controls:
Spacebar to pause/unpause
V to cycle background through fields (electric->magnetic->strong red->strong green->strong blue->electric)
S to spawn particles
D to delete particles
E to toggle behavior of the screen edge between deletion and reflection
